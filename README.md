# Tableau File SDK

This project is an attempt to create an SDK for a Tableau Workbook file. It is being written completely in C#, with a focus on only using built in System Assemblies, no NuGet packages.

I came across the Workbook SDK that Power Tools for Tableau sells, however, it is priced at $5000. I believe that this is an extremely unfair price to make developers pay if they want to create Tableau Workbooks programmatically, so I decided to attempt to create my own SDK.

I want to be clear that I am not using any code from the Workbook SDK by Power Tools for Tableau. I am not infringing on any copywrites, I have not seen the code that they use. I am writing this from scratch so that I can learn more about how Tableau Workbooks are written.

More to the point, since I am not backed by a company that focuses all of their energy on Tableau development like Power Tools for Tableau (which I believe is backed by Interworks), my version is probably going to be coded a lot slower, and will most likely not be as robust as theirs.

## Installation

When it is finished being developed, to install, you need to download the DLL file that the class will be compiled into, and load it into your project.

## Usage

When it is finished, then I will write usage instructions.
